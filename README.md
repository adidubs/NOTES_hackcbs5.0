# Notes_App_HackCBS_5.0
# NOTES ANDROID APPLICATION USING JAVA
## Problem Statment (&#x1F4D6;) :
Many a times we the students want to make our notes without even using the pen and paper. But we do not have any sufficient application which allows us to perform speech to text , QR code to text and Image to text under a single platform .
So, through our android application application we will be solving these problems under a single platform
- **1.Speech to Text Convert** ->This feature will allow the user to speak all of his notes and through that the speech is converted to text.This feature can be used easily by
teachers and students.
- **2.QR TO TEXT CONVERTER** -> This feature will help the students to scan any data which has been provided to them in the form of the QR and can easily read and copy those set of data.
Here any data provided in the form of QR can be easily read and copied in the app
- **3.IMAGE T0 TEXT CONVERTOR** -> This feature will help the student to convert any information which is in the form of image into a text format
